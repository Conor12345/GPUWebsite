            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Decreased processing time as there can be multiple processors working on a task simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Increased reliablity compared to single systems as some processors can be lost and the program can continue at a slower speed.</li>
                <li>Scalability cost reduced as more processing power is achieved by more processors rather than upgrading single processors/machines.</li>
                <li>Much higher max throughput of data as the system can be scaled to any size assuming the software is created properly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>More complicated software is needed, especially when breaking large tasks into sub tasks which can increase upfront cost.</li>
                <li>Some tasks cannot be parallelized as they constantly rely on early calculations (i.e. each part of the program can only occur once the previous has been completed.</li>
                <li>Can be more resource intensize in lightweight workloads due to the extra processing needed to parallelize the program.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Multicore computers</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Multicore computers</b> are used everywhere nowadays to allow computers to multitask more easily. The utilization of the mutliple cores is generally handled by the operating system by
        allocating different programs to run on different CPU cores. Some programs (generally resource intensive ones such as games and productivity software) are designed to utilize multiple cores in
        which case the operating system can allocate the software multiple cores which it can use more freely. The main benefits of multicore computers are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Multitasking</b> - Users can run many programs at once which each processing core handling different programs.</li>
        <li><b>Power</b> - Multiple cores can be used to acceelerate certain programs which would run slowly on a single processing core.</li>
        <l><b></b></l>
    </ul>
