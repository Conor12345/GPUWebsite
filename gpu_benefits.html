            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>GPUs can do a large number of calculations at the same time and they as massively parallel.</li>
                <li>The specialized processors onboard can be used to accelerate a variety of workloads such as video rendering and some CAD programs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>GPUs can only do specific calculations such as geometry or physics.</li>
                <li>They cannot be used as the primary processor in a computer as they do not have all the neccesary functions.</li>
                <li>GPUs are very complex therefore they are expensive.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <h2>When are GPUs used and why?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rendering graphics</b> - GPUs original function was to render 3D graphics which is still their primary function for both personal use (generally in video games) or in industry (video
            and photo rendering).
        </li>
        <li><b>Machine Learning</b> - Training artificial intelligence programs requires repeating thousands of iterations and tests which is accelerated using the parallel processing power of GPUs.
        </li>
        <li><b>Crypto-currency mining</b> - Crypto-curency mining involves solving very complex maths so that your device will be chosen to validate a transaction making the user money in process.
            This is an ideal use of GPUs as they can do thousands of calculations per second, increasing the likelihood of finding the correct answer.

    </ul>
