Explain the purpose of GPUs and what applications they are used for (you need to understand how GPUs are used to aid graphics,
but also other applications for example their use in modeling, data mining, etc.).

You should describe the benefits of using GPUs and why they are suited to certain tasks.

Describe what is meant by a parallel system and the benefits and limitations of parallel processing. (give examples)

Describe how parallel processing can be achieved through different (i.e. multiple processors in the same computer or distributed across multiple cores in a CPU or GPU).

Describe the benefits of a multicore system in terms of parallel processing and running multiple programs at the same time.

I am expecting your websites to contain good use of CSS - including using classes and ID's to format sections and tags appropriately.
