        <b>Parallel systems</b> (also known as parallel computing) is a computing method which allows for a large task to be broken down in smaller parts which are run silmulatenously to increase the
        speed. These types of computer systems are neccesary to continue to increase out computing capability as the single core frequency of new processors is becoming harder and harder to increase
        due to material constraints in the processors.
