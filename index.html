        <b>Graphics Processing Units</b> are specialized computer processors, designed to run many calculations simultaneously, originally designed for rendering video games. Nowadays, they are
        used in a wide variety of different industrys, from machine learning to crypto currency mining.

    <h2>How do GPUs work?</h2>
    <p>
        GPUs are designed to repeat many similar calculations at once, allowing it do parallel tasks a CPU would not be capable of. They have thousands of very basic processors which only have a small
        number of functions, though these do include some complex geometry. This made them perfect for rendering graphics as it involves repeating geometric calculations for every pixel on the screen.
        For most of their history, they were used exclusively for rendering graphics but in recent years they have begun to be used for a larger number of tasks such as machine learning and data
        analysis. Video and photo editing have also begun to utilize GPU's for acceleration of rendering and editing though this is still not widespread due to the complexity of the implementation.

    <h2>How are CPUs and GPUs different?</h2>

        CPU's have a small number of processing cores which each have a large number of availible instructions as they are the general purpose processor which controls the whole computer. GPU's have a
        large number of processing cores which each only have a few instructions, this makes them highly specialized and ideal for situations where a large amount of simple calculations need to be run
        simultaneously such as when rendering graphics.
